# FrCode
03/06/2023 Updated master with latest code used 

This is collection of python code that I have written over my time as a PhD student. The goal of this repo was to store some of my useful for future FrPNC graduate students. If others happen upon this and find something useful, then wonderful.

The important physics code is in the `Phyiscs` directory. The `atomic_info.py` file contains some basic atomic properties for Rb87, Fr211, Fr210, and Cs133. The `transition_rate.py` file was used to calculate the transition rates for the forbidden M1 transition in Fr211. The spectra_fitter.py file allows on-the-fly binning that complements our DAQ system on site at TRIUMF. It also fits the spectra using iminuit. The other files are mostly utility, which maybe useful.

The `Cavity` directory contains calculations for the power build-up cavity.
